# What-factors-influence-IVF-treatment-cost-at-clinics-in-Ahmedabad-
Several factors can influence the IVF treatment cost in Ahmedabad. First and foremost is the patient’s fertility condition—if there are complex issues such as PCOS, low sperm count, or endometriosis, additional tests or treatments may be needed. The woman’s age also plays a significant role, as older women might require higher dosages of stimulation medication or additional cycles. Another factor is whether procedures like ICSI, embryo freezing, donor sperm/eggs, or blastocyst transfer are involved. These advanced techniques often increase the overall cost. Moreover, some clinics may charge separately for consultations, investigations, and medications. Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad is known for its transparent IVF pricing structure, where patients are informed about all possible expenses in advance. This helps couples plan financially and ensures they receive quality care without hidden costs.
